If you never register a “data” event handler and never call the pipe() method, then a Readable stream remains in paused mode. In paused mode, the stream does not push data to you in the form of “data” events. Instead, you pull data from the stream by explicitly calling its read() method. This is not a blocking call, and if there is no data available to read on the stream, it will return null. Since there is not a synchronous API to wait for data, the paused mode API is also event-based. A Readable stream in paused mode emits “readable” events when data becomes available to read on the stream. In response, your code should call the read() method to read that data. You must do this in a loop, calling read() repeatedly until it returns null. It is necessary to completely drain the stream’s buffer like this in order to trigger a new “readable” event in the future. If you stop calling read() while there is still readable data, you will not get another “readable” event and your program is likely to hang.')]),e._v(" "),a("p",[e._v("Streams in paused mode emit “end” and “error” events just like flowing mode streams do.
